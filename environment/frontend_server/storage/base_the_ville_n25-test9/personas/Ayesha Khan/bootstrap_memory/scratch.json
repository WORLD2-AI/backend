For example, I think Sarah Kay does a beautiful job of weaving classical elements like those found in Shakespeare\u2019s works into her contemporary poetry. Have you read any of her work?"

Her ability to connect with the reader on such a personal level is something I admire. It\u2019s always inspiring to see how different poets interpret Shakespearean techniques in their unique voices. If you have any recommendations for other poets I should explore, I'd love to hear them!"
