The instructor gave me some great feedback today, and I\u2019m starting to feel more confident. How\u2019s the Shakespeare lecture going? Are you enjoying it?"

But I have to admit, improv sounds like a fun challenge! Do you think it\u2019s helping you with your confidence in other areas too?"

      "Francisco Lopez",
      "Absolutely! Improv has been a game-changer for me. It\u2019s not just about being funny\u2014it\u2019s about trusting yourself and going with the flow, which has helped me feel more comfortable in all kinds of situations. Like, even when I\u2019m brainstorming ideas for my web series, I feel more open to trying new things. What about you? Do you think studying Shakespeare has influenced how you approach other subjects or even everyday conversations?"

      "Ayesha Khan",

It\u2019s made me more deliberate in my writing and even in how I express myself in conversations. But I\u2019m curious\u2014do you ever find yourself drawing connections between improv and Shakespeare? Like, maybe the way characters in his plays have to think on their feet in certain scenes?"

      "Francisco Lopez",
      "That\u2019s such a great point! I hadn\u2019t thought about it that way, but now that you mention it, there are definitely similarities. Like in Shakespeare\u2019s comedies, characters often have to improvise in tricky situations, and it\u2019s all about timing and delivery\u2014just like in improv! It\u2019s cool how both art forms rely on quick thinking and creativity. Maybe we should collaborate sometime\u2014improv meets Shakespeare? That could be a fun project!"

      "Francisco Lopez",
