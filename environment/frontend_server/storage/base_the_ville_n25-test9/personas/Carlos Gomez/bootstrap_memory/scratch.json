Speaking of techniques, do you have a favorite Shakespearean technique you've been exploring for your thesis?"

It's fascinating how he uses language to reveal the inner thoughts of his characters. Is there a particular aspect of his writing that you find most challenging to emulate?"

      "Carlos Gomez",

    ],
    [
      "Ayesha Khan",
      "I can see how that would be challenging, Carlos. There are a few modern poets I\u2019ve been reading who have interesting takes. For example, I think Sarah Kay does a beautiful job of weaving classical elements like those found in Shakespeare\u2019s works into her contemporary poetry. Have you read any of her work?"
    ],
    [
      "Carlos Gomez",
      "Yes, I've read some of Sarah Kay's poems, and I love how she brings classical influences into her work while keeping it fresh and relatable. Her ability to connect with the reader on such a personal level is something I admire. It\u2019s always inspiring to see how different poets interpret Shakespearean techniques in their unique voices. If you have any recommendations for other poets I should explore, I'd love to hear them!"

      "Ayesha Khan",

    ],
    [
      "Carlos Gomez",
