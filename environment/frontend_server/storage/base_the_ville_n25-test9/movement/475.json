Nature is such a universal theme in Shakespeare\u2019s works\u2014like the forest in *A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream* or the storm in *The Tempest*. We could definitely explore how improv could bring those elements to life in a fresh way. Maybe even use nature-inspired prompts to guide the improvisation. What kind of nature themes do you focus on in your poetry?"

Imagine using improv to capture the fleeting beauty of a sunrise as a backdrop for a soliloquy!"
