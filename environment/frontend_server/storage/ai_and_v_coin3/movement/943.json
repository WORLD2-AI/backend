By leveraging real-time data analysis and predictive modeling, AI can identify and mitigate speculative behaviors before they escalate into bubbles. In fact, I'm currently fine-tuning my model to incorporate similar principles. How do you envision AI tools being implemented in your internship training for stock market analysis?"
