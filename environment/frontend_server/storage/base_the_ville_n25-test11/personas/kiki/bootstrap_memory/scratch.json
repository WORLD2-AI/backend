Coincidentally, she ran into Latoya Williams and Cichengege on a bridge during their date.\n\nKiki walked up to them, tearfully questioning Cichengege about why he was with another woman. Cichengege felt extremely awkward but tried to comfort Kiki first. In the end, the two returned home together in silence.",
