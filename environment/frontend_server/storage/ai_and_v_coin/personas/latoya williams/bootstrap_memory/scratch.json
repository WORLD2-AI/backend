Latoya Williams was selecting items in the outdoor section. \nAt 10:20 AM, Latoya Williams walked towards the snack section and encountered Kiki and Cichenggege.

Latoya Williams fell for Cichenggege at first sight, invited him for a drink, and they began a flirtatious conversation.\nAt 8:30 PM, Kiki came over and greeted them. Latoya Williams was actually quite calm inside.\nAt 8:40 PM, Kiki confessed to Cichenggege, who did not respond. Latoya Williams seemed to have anticipated this outcome.\nAt 9:00 PM, Latoya Williams left the Moonlight Tavern Bar and went home.",
