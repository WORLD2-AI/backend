What specific mechanisms are you using to eliminate bubbles?"

For example, it adjusts transaction fees dynamically based on market volatility and imposes limits on high-frequency trading. I think integrating similar mechanisms into FitCoin could help create a more stable and sustainable ecosystem. Would you be open to discussing this further over a coffee sometime?"
