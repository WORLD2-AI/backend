If people understand how AI algorithms make decisions, they\u2019ll feel more confident and less skeptical.

What do you think about creating a community-driven platform where people can learn and discuss AI in finance?"

It could also foster collaboration between experts and newcomers, which might lead to more innovative and ethical solutions. I\u2019d love to explore this further\u2014maybe we could even collaborate on something like that in the future. For now, though, I should probably head to work and prepare for a meeting with MK about integrating AI into trading simulations. Thanks for the insightful conversation!"
